                                        Triveni Sangam dates back thousands of years and is the sacred confluence of three riversâ€”Hiran, Kapila, and Saraswati. This is the site where Lord Krishna was cremated after his passing in Bhalka. People visit this holy place to perform Pitru Yagna and seek moksha for their ancestors.

                                The greatest significance of Triveni Sangam is that it is the site of Lord Krishna's cremation. It is believed that he took his last breath here and wished to be cremated on this sacred soil. Krishna's passing serves as a reminder that even gods must submit to death, teaching us about the cycle of life and death. You can learn more about this event in the Bhalka section.
