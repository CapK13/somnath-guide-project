            Where It All Began (In Ancient Times)

            <p className='lg:text-xl text-md'>Someshwar is known as the first-ever Shivlinga, created by Shiva himself.</p>

            <p className='lg:text-xl text-md'>
                Legend says that Chandradev (the Lord of the Moon) once insulted and mocked Ganesha’s appearance,
                believing himself to be the most beautiful god. In response, to humble Chandradev, Ganesha cursed him,
                causing him to lose all his light and beauty as the god of the moon.
            </p>

            <p className='lg:text-xl text-md'>
                To rid himself of this curse, Chandradev began performing intense Tapasya (meditation) to seek the
                blessings of Mahadev, who is known as Bholenath (the kindest god). After enduring great hardships,
                Mahadev was impressed by his devotion and decided to lift Chandradev’s curse. He descended to Earth
                and restored Chandradev’s light and beauty.
            </p>

            <p className='lg:text-xl text-md'>
                Realizing his mistake, Chandradev wished to ensure that this lesson of humility and devotion 
                would be remembered forever. As an act of gratitude, he requested Mahadev to create a Shivlinga
                as a symbol of kindness for future generations. This is how the first-ever Jyotirlinga was created,
                known today as Someshwar.

            <p className='lg:text-xl text-md'>The word "Som" also means Moon (Chandra).</p>

                The site of Somnath has been a pilgrimage destination since ancient times due to its location 
                at the Triveni Sangam, the confluence of three rivers: Kapila, Hiran, and Saraswati.
            </p>

            <p className='lg:text-xl text-md'>
                The Gurjara-Pratihara king Nagabhata II recorded that he visited the tirthas in Saurashtra, 
                including Someshvara, an alternative name for the temple. In 1026, during the reign of Bhima I, 
                the Turkic Muslim ruler Mahmud of Ghazni raided and plundered the Somnath temple, 
                destroying its Jyotirlinga. He looted wealth worth 20 million dinars.

            <p className='lg:text-xl text-md'>
                Kumarapala (1143–1172) rebuilt the Somnath temple in fine stone and adorned it with jewels, 
                according to an inscription from 1169. He replaced a decaying wooden temple with a grand stone structure.
            </p>

            <p className='lg:text-xl text-md'>
                During its 1299 invasion of Gujarat, Alauddin Khalji’s army, led by Ulugh Khan, 
                defeated the Vaghela king Karna and sacked the Somnath temple. The temple was later rebuilt in 1308 
                by Mahipala I, the Chudasama king of Saurashtra, and the lingam was installed by his son Khengara 
                between 1331 and 1351.
            </p>

            <p className='lg:text-xl text-md'>
                In 1395, the temple was destroyed for the third time by Zafar Khan, 
                the last governor of Gujarat under the Delhi Sultanate and later the founder of the Gujarat Sultanate.

            <p className='lg:text-xl text-md'>The Contribution of Sardar Patel</p>

            <p className='lg:text-xl text-md'>
                Sardar Patel, who was then the Home Minister of India, visited Junagadh (Saurashtra region) 
                and announced the reconstruction of the Somnath temple. As per Mahatma Gandhi’s suggestion, 
                a trust was established under K. M. Munshi to fund the project. The idea was that the reconstruction 
                should be funded collectively by the people rather than the secular government.
            </p>

            <p className='lg:text-xl text-md'>
                In 1951, K. M. Munshi invited the then-President of India, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, 
                to inaugurate (Pran-Pratistha) the newly rebuilt temple.
            </p>

            <p className='lg:text-xl text-md'>
                Despite repeated destruction, the Somnath Temple was rebuilt multiple times by various Hindu dynasties 
                and kings. The rebuilding of the temple is a testament to the resilience of the Hindu faith and the 
                determination of devotees to restore their sacred site. The present-day Somnath Temple is a result 
                of these collective reconstruction efforts.
            </p>

            <p className='lg:text-xl text-md'>
                This temple stands as a symbol of the valor of the warriors who sacrificed their lives to protect their culture.
